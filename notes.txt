Example: JSON vs. JavaScript Object

‚úÖ Valid JSON (String format)
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25
}

‚ùå JavaScript Object (Not JSON)
{
  name: "Alice", // No double quotes around keys (allowed in JS, not in JSON)
  age: 25
}

The JavaScript engine does not directly understand JSON as a native data structure. 
JSON is just a text-based format for data exchange, not a JavaScript object.
So we need to convert JSON format to JavaScript Object and to do that we use this middleware
app.use(express.json());

What is Multer ?
Multer is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is 
primarily used for uploading files. It is written on top of busboy for maximum efficiency.

üìå Why Do We Need Multer?
Express does not handle file uploads by default.
Multer makes it easy to upload images, PDFs, videos, etc.
It stores files in your server‚Äôs storage (or memory) for further processing.
